# ItemRestrict
Hi, I'm simply updating a useful plugin I've been using for years, original links:
* https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/item-restrict-by-craftersland.7255/
* https://github.com/brunyman/ItemRestrict

#### How to compile
1. Clone the repo to your pc.
2. Run `mvn clean package` using maven from the command line.
3. You will find the jar in the target directory, its the one that doesn't have "original-" in its name.
